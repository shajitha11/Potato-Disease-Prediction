 Potato Disease Prediction Using Deep Learning

A deep learning-based image classification model that detects "potato leaf diseases" from images.
Trained using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on a labeled dataset of potato leaf images. 

This project can identify:
    Early Blight  
    Late Blight  
    Healthy
